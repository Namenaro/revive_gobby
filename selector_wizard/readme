Selector has structure:
{
    "dataset": "some/path/to/dataset"  # PATH TO INITIAL JSON DATASET, WICH WAS USED TO CREATE THAT SELECTOR
    patient_id: {point:measurement}
   }

 Here patient_ids are the keys of dictionary and they are the same as keys in initial dataset.
 {point:measurement} is a dictionary with
 coordinates as keys, and measurements (by model at these coordinates) as values.
